1. First, you need to install the Java development environment. If you have not already, please download and install the latest version of Java from [official website](https://www.java.com/zh-CN/download/).
2. Create a new folder on your computer and copy the VmessConverter source code to that folder.
3. Open a command prompt window or terminal. In Windows, you can press 'Win+R', then type 'cmd' and press Enter to open a command prompt window. On Mac OS or Linux systems, you can use terminal applications.
4. Navigate to the folder containing the source code for VmessConverter. For example, if your source code is in a folder named 'vmessconverter', you can enter the following command in a command prompt window or terminal: 'cd /path/to/vmessconverter'. Note that you need to replace '/path/to' with the actual path.
5. Compile the VmessConverter source code. Enter the following command in a command prompt window or terminal: 'javac VmessConverter.java'. If all goes well, the compilation process should complete quickly and without any error messages.
6. Run the VmessConverter program. Enter the following command in a command prompt window or terminal: 'java VmessConverter'. At this point, the program should display instructions and command line options. If you want to convert the JSON-formatted configuration to a vmess URL, follow the instructions in the program output. For example, you can type the following command on the command line: `java VmessConverter "{\"v\":\"2\",\"ps\":\"My Vmess  Server\",\"add\":\"example.com\",\"port\":443,\"id\":\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\",\"aid\":\"64\",\"net\":\"t Cp \ ", \ "type \" : \ "none \", \ "the TLS \" : true, \ "the host \", \ "\"} "` at example.com. Note that you need to replace the JSON string with the JSON configuration that you are actually converting.
